## License

iBitHub is released under the terms of the MIT license. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for more

## Development Process

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [GitHub](https://github.com/ibithub/ibithub) 



## Testing

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull requests than we can review and test on short notice. Please be patient and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people lots of money.
